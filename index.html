                      If you ask what is a Transformer, in general, people will easily define a car that becomes a killer machine (or something like this).
                      However, in the NLP field a Transformer is not even close to any car, or any killer, nor anything like this. <br>
                      In 2017, Google introduced to the world <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attention is all you need</a>, the paper that would not only change the meaning of what a Transformer is but also revolutionize

                     All in all, Transformers are a very powerful tool to develop Deep Learning projects. Despite of it, it is essential to understand the background and have a good 
                     knowledge on how this works and runs internally. <br>
                     In this project we approach to Explainable AI in order to comprehend the basis of the Transformers, so anyone who is interested on the theme can expand their notions on the theme 
                     via visualization and interaction. <br> <br>
                     All the results and visualizations shown have been extracted using a real transformer and the task we will focus on is Translation, concretely from English to French. Nonetheless, 
                     Transformers are also suitable to perform <strong>language modeling</strong>. <br>
                    The network used is pretrained with the  <a href="http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACL 2014 ninth workshop

                        Seq-to-Seq (also known as Seq2Seq) is the abbreviation of sequence-to-sequence, which is the characteristic that indicates that a model is trained with sequences of data (rather than 
                        single units) and transforms them into another sequence in some other domain. In a machine translation context, this means that the algorithm works with a sequence of language units from the source language (English in our case) and 
                        translates the whole sequence into the target language (French).

                          An embedding is the representation of some unit of the natural language in the form of a vector of real numbers. <br>
                          For instance, an embedding could be a vector of 26 numbers where each of them represented the i-th letter of the alphabet and the quantity of the times such letter was found in a certain word.
                          However, embeddings tend to be more complex than this last example in which <strong>coin</strong> and <strong> icon </strong> would provide the same representation and that would be problematic.
                          Recall that the vector represents the structure of the language we choose, not necessarily words: they could represent a letter, part of a word, a word or a whole sentence itself.
                          Although, the most common is for them to be a word or part of it.</p>

                        In this Transformer architecture, each embedding represents a part of the word. The tokenization found depends on several aspects:
                        the algorithm of tokenization chosen, the frequency it has on the language and the encoding that is applied. <br>
                        In addition, in this case, punctuation signs count with an own token (commas, apostrophes, etc) and a special one (&#60eos&#62) is used to indicate end of sentence. However, we 
                        insist that this is characteristic of the chosen architecture and, thus, not a generalized or standard processing of the words.<br>
                        One rapidly sees that the relationship between tokens and words is not linear, as it can be appreciated on the example.

                    The attention mechanism permits the network to identify which tokens are more related between them. In human terms, it is the 
                  intuition that tells you that what is eaten is the carrot and who eats it is my mum. Mathematically, this is more abstract and harder to explain but 
                the base of all is the scaled dot-product attention and three specific vectors K, Q and V (shown on the right). We will dig into detail in <a href="#attention">Attention</a>.<br>
                We will also see that the Transformer uses what is called  <strong>multi-head attention</strong> and its types.

                    We have seen how the Neural Network identifies a word and how it relates their meanings, but how does it determine the order of the words? 
                    Because obviously, saying 'My mum eats a carrot' is not the same as 'A carrot eats my mum'. <br>
                    This is achieved thanks to what we call <strong>positional encoding</strong>, a vector of the same dimension as the embeddings that somehow contains information about the position 
                    of the token within a sentence. Said vectors can be trained weights (optimized during training) or pre-defined functions that work well enough. In the transformer,
                    the autors tried both methods using a mix of sinusoidal functions for the latter one, which they kept, as the results were pretty similar with both techniques.

                  Also known as skip connections or skip-layer connections, are those steps in which a vector is copied and ommits one ore more layers and then it is used at the output of a posterior layer along with the output itself. There, it can be concatenated or added.  <br>
                  They are useful to avoid vanishing gradient problems and they act in such a way that the network does not 'forget' the past as easily, allowing the model to perform better. 
                  As we will see in the architecture, the Transformer counts with several of them and are important to achieve the results it has. For instance,
                  positional information does not get lost or vanished due to the residual connections.</p>

                    This type of architecture is a Neural Network that transforms the data using two modules: the Encoder and the Decoder. <br>
                    The first one transforms the original data into an internal representation of it, that is sometimes referred as <strong>latent data</strong> in the literature.
                    The second one takes said representations and transforms it into a desired target. <br>
                    As for translation purposes, the Encoder works with the source language and the decoder outputs the translation in the target language.
                    If the latent representations were generic enough, just by changing the Decoder one could train a Decoder that translated to any possible language.

                  <p class="mb-4 tm-arch-text">
                    The input received in both parts, the Encoder and the Decoder, is an embedding that represents a token (recall, a part of a word).
                    As this type of Neural Network is not recurrent (a type of network that does have a notion of temporality), it is added to each embedding
                    some specific weights that will determine the position each token has within the sentence, the <strong>positional encoding</strong>. <br>
                    To exemplify, we input the English embeddings of the sentence in the Encoder. In the Decoder, we input the translated right shifted embedding of the encoder input. On other words: the
                    last embedding we predicted in French. <br>
                    To summarise, for each sentence we generate the tokens, we add the positional information and, then, they are ready to enter to the Encoder or the Decoder.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              The weights of the positional encoding can be trained or determined by a function, typically a sinusoidal one. In the paper, said function is the following: <br>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align:center;"> 
                \(PE_{(pos,2i)}=sin(pos/10000^{2i/dmodel})\) <br>
                \(PE_{(pos,2i+1)}=cos(pos/10000^{2i/dmodel})\)
              </p>
              where \(pos\) is the position of the token in the sentence, \(d_{model}\) the dimension of the embeddings and \(i\) represents the position within the embedding.
              <br>
              In other words, in this particular case, to each embedding we add weights that come determined by the alternation of a sine and a cosine function (observable at your right) whose 
              objective is to state in which position a certain token is found.

                    After having the input embeddings prepared, the source language embeddings enter one by one to the Encoder, which will transform them into a
                    latent representation and will eventually go inside the Decoder. <br>
                    It is worth mentioning that, unlike Recurrent Neural Networks, the input is just one vector and therefore we don't have the positional information 
                    contained in any way, this is why positional encoding is needed. <br>
                    Both modules contain mainly two blocks of layers: Feed Forward and attention blocks. In addition, they also count with residual connections and normalization steps.
                    All of them are repeated in a total of N stacks (being N=6). That is, we have 6 times what we see in the diagrams. <br>
                    This module is the most basic of the two.

              <div class="tm-basics-text-container">
                As we mentioned, in each module of the architecture, there can be found two main blocks, the first one is the Feed Forward. They are fully-connected Feed Forward Networks that 
                are applied to each position separately and identically. They consist of two layers with a ReLU activation in between and
                the operations equate the behaviour of two convolutions of a kernel of size 1. <br>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:center;"> 
                  \(FFN(x) = max(0,xW_1+b_1)W_2+b_2\)
                </p>
                After each stack of layers, both in the Encoder and the Decoder, we have a skip connection and a normalization layer. This 
                helps the network to 'remember' the past and have small values in the embeddings.

                The second main components inside the modules are the Attention blocks. In this paper, it is performed a simple
                attention mechanism (scaled dot-product) that is combined with what it is called <strong>heads</strong>. This combination of techniques result
                in what is known as Multi-Head Attention. <br>
                Each block of attention consists of a linear layer, a scale dot-product attention layer, a concatenation step and a final linear layer.
                Also, one of the blocks (the first found in the Decoder) is referenced as Masked Multi-Head Attention. This is because we don't have all the information when predicting at that step,
                so a mask is applied when training. <br>

                    The Decoder architecture is pretty similar to the previous one. In fact, we could say that, after the first Attention block and normalization, the architecture is basically the same. <br>
                    However, the most noticeable differences are the inputs it has. <br>
                    The first (at the beginning of the Decoder) is the target language embeddings shifted right (as we have already mentioned, the last predicted embedding). <br>
                    The second one (in the middle of the module), passes the Encoder output and the Decoder embeddings that we have until that step, as input. <br>
                    Also, in here, we have two Attention blocks, the first one being the masked attention block and the second a regular one. <br>
                    Notice that after the Decoder module we find two final layers, a linear layer and a softmax layer that will be in charge of choosing the most probable translation.

                      As we have introduced, attention is in simple words, the mechanism that stablishes the relevance of a token in relationship with another. 
                      <br> To do so, it is necessary to 
                      define the three components used: key (K), query (Q) and values (V). These are the vectors that we combine (map) in such a way that produce an output (also a vector) whose values define the mentioned relationships. <br>
                      The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query (Q) with the corresponding key (K). <br>
                      In other words, K and Q are used to define weights that will be used against V to define the importance between tokens. 
                      We have three blocks in the Transformer architecture that perform this evaluation, but first let's describe better what an attention block does.

                        After performing the softmax, the result is scaled by \(d_k\) (the dimension of the embedding) and after it, it is multiplied by V. This way it is ensured that the vectors
                        we deal with are normalized at each step, a fact that is really helpful to avoid overflows and numeric problems.

                <p class="mb-4 tm-more-text">
                    Up to this point, you might be wondering what exactly are heads in terms of Attention and what do they have to do in here. <br>
                    Well, conceptually heads are not so willing to explain with an example because they are more like a helping 'feature' rather than a palpable thing itself. <br>
                    Heads is the name assigned to the number of partitions we do to the input vectors (K, Q and V) in order to compute attention separately. This allows the segmentation of the attention
                    calculations and therefore the parallelization of this part of the model. Not only do we focus in smaller parts but also we permit them to be computed in a faster way
                    that allows a faster training. <br>
                    So it is as simple as dividing the input vectors K, Q, and V into <strong>head</strong> parts. Then, they follow the same procedure as previously: a linear layer and the scale dot-product.
                    After it, we just concatenate the 'pieces' and pass through a last linear layer. <br>
                    In the gif it can be observed the case where the number of heads is 3.

                It's time to talk a little bit about the software part of the network. We are going to review, in general terms, which is the loss function, how the problem is 
                presented and some details that might be taken into account when building and training such Neural Network.

                  
                <h2 class="tm-text-primary-train mb-4"> Loss function </h2>
                
                <p class="text-white mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                The loss function that is minimized is known as the Cross Entropy Loss and is defined as follows:
                </p>
                
                <p style="text-align:center;"> 
                    \( \displaystyle {L(y,\hat{y}) = - \sum_{k} y^{(k)} log\;( \hat{y}^{(k)} )} \)

                  <p class="text-white mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                Being \(k\) the total number of classes, \(y\) the target probabilities and \(\hat{y}\) the predicted probabilities.
                As can be seen, it is generalized to any number of classes one may desire. It is also vary useful and suitable for 
                classification problems, as it penalizes more the wrong predictions and rewards more the correct one in comparison with what other losses would do.

                <h2 class="tm-text-primary-train mb-4"> Masks and prediction </h2>
                <p class="text-white mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                We have already talked about masks. A masks is a special token that replaces another token in a way that the Neural Network "does not take it into account". By this we mean that, if a token 
                is replaced by the token &#60mask&#62, the Transformer will have no information on that so it would work as if it wasn't there.
                Masks are used during training in the first Decoder Attention Block as we have seen in the <a href="#architecture">Architecture</a>.
                Similarly, masks are applied in many tasks of NLP, for instance, when training a next-word-prediction network, the future words are also masked so that the network doesn't cheat.

                If you wanted to train a Transformer architecture by yourself you would have two options: <br> <br>
              
                Train from scratch with your own data with and your own coded architecture (or one imported from some library). <br> <br>
                This is a tricky one as you would need to take into account: what dimensions to choose, how to perform the data processing (tokenization, deal with case sensitivity),
                choose hyperparameters, optimizers, etc. Let's be honest, coding from scratch is not really common unless you have a special interest on doing all that by yourself. It is more common to take 
                the models available in different libraries and train with your own data, however if you don't have a big amount of data the best option is the next one. <br>

                    You can take a pretrained network and fine-tune.
                    One of the advantages of the Transformers is that they are suitable for many tasks and contexts, typically for NLP, even though they can be used outside the language processing field. 
                    Here we have used the Transformer to translate from English to French. Needless to say, having a proper dataset in any other language would serve to train a translator to said language.
                    Besides, translation is not the only task that this type of architecture can perform. <br> 
                    Due to the outstanding results it provided, many different architectures and varieties arised since the publication of the original paper in 2017 and there are many open-source libraries that provide the code, data and 
                    architecure to be able to train your own network.<br>

                    We have learned what an Encoder-Decoder architecture is, in addition, it is interesting to have a look at the so-called Auto-Encoder. 
                    This type of network is pretty famous and used as it is a simple but effective unsupervised method. <br>
                    It consists of a network that is trained to predict exactly the same as it receives as input (weird right?). The trick of it is in the bottleneck (latent data) that is smaller than the initial and final dimension, 
                    this way we train the autoencoder so that it compresses the most relevant information and remains condensed in a lowered-dimension vector than the original. <br>
                    It is really helpful for compression, image segmentation, face recognition, etc.

                <p>Special tokens are also a helpful feature to take into account. We have introduced the end-of-sentence tokens used in the paper. However, it is also usual

                <p>Byte Pair Encoding (or digram coding) is a simple form of data compression. 
                  It consists in replacing the most common pair of consecutive bytes of the data with a byte that does not occur within that data.
                  In NLP, it is a technique that can be applied as part of the preprocessing of the data and can help to reduce, memory-wise, the size
                of the sets (training, validation and testing) considerably. This way, the training is speeded up while the quality is not seen affected. </p>

                <br>
                <p>Label Smoothing is a regularization technique that introduces noise for the labels / target. By doing this we prevent the network to work with absolute zeroes,
                  hence saving it from computational issues. It is an easy, yet really helpful, technique to help the model generalize instead of overfitting by following really
                  strict patterns which, in the end, are not found in real life or when predicting never-seen-before targets.
                  As a matter of fact, it is only used in classification problems that use the cross-entropy function.

                <br>
                 <p>As we already know, positional encoding is what provides the network with the <strong>order</strong> information within the words or tokens. Quoting the authors:
                  "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, 
                  we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence." <br></p>

                      <p> However, what do sinusoidal functions have to do with order? <br>
                      It is all related with the way bits change as they grow. If we observe the evolution of the bits when augmenting the numbers from one to five in binary, we observe the behaviour found in the right. <br>
                      Somehow, every time we increase a number, this behaves at some level as a sinusoidal movement, here the reason why this type of function is appropiate for this task. </p>

                <br>
                <p>As this projects intends to understand the overall ideas and intuitions behind the Transformer rather than digging into the details, we have avoided as much as possible 
                  mentioning dimensions and numbers. Furthermore, they have many different factors that can affect them (the type of architecture, the structure of it, the way one may want to train the model,
                  the size of the data, the resources available, etc). However, there is one dimension that is interesting and useful in this type of task and does not always appear explained: the <strong>beam dimension</strong>. <br><br>
                  We could define the beam dimension as the hypothesis dimension we allow the model to investigate. As we already mentioned, the input of the Decoder is the last output and it can drag error.
                  That is why the network takes the top B most probable words to be the translated (being B the beam dimension), predicts each of the B most probable next words / tokens and keeps, from the B first hypothesized words, the one that provides less error. This is repeated at each step.
                  <br> <br>
                  An example, if we want to translate our already known base sentence: <strong>My mum eats a carrot</strong>. We start the process, our beam dimension is \(B=2\), for the first word we hypothesize the translation to be <strong>ma</strong> and <strong>mon</strong>. The network will translate the following word taking into account 
                  both articles: <strong>ma mère</strong> and <strong>mon mère</strong> and will conclude that, based on the error, <strong>ma</strong> is a better prediction.
                  <br><br>
                  This does not magically convert the network in the perfect translation machine, however it does lower the possibility of making a wrong prediction.

              <button class="accordion">Softmax function</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>We have mentioned that after the Decoder, as latest step of the forward pass, we apply the softmax function that is: <br>
                  <p style="text-align:center;"> 
                    \( softmax(x_{i}) = \displaystyle{\frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j \exp(x_j)}}\)
                  </p>
                  The softmax function tries to replicate the behaviour of the maximum function. However, as computing it is not differentiable,
                  it would not be possible for the network to propagate the gradients through it (plainly, we couldn't train the network as it would not update the weights).
                  For this reason a differentiable function that simulates the maximum is good enough; and it is called <strong>soft</strong> as we still preserve a part of the non-maximum labels.
                </p>
              </div> 

              <button class="accordion">Activation functions</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>Activation functions determine if a neuron will be <strong>activated</strong> according to the value it has received. If this happens, the weights connected to the mentioned neuron will be updated during the backpropagation.
                  
                  In this architecture we have seen the ReLU activation,
                  which is the abbreviation for Rectified Linear Unit. This function activates the neuron in case the input received is higher than 0, that is: </p>
                  <p style="text-align:center;"> 
                    \( ReLU(x) = max(0, x) \)
                  </p>
                <p> However there are lots of different activation functions, each of them more suitable for certain contexts and tasks. Between the most common ones 
                  we can find the tangent activation function, sigmoid, linear... and many combinations or versions of it: Leaky ReLU, ELU, maxout, etc. Furthermore, the softmax function could also be included in this list.

              <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>The convolution is a type of operation usually performed in signal processing. It works with two functions: the main signal and 
                  the kernel function and it expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. Mathematically it is written as:</p>
                  <p style="text-align:center;"> 
                    \( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = \displaystyle{ (x*h)(t):=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }x(\tau )h(t-\tau )\,d\tau }\)
                  </p>
                <p> Being \(y(t)\) the convolution result, \(x(t)\) the signal and \(h(t)\) the kernel. <br>
                  It has many uses and applications, even in Deep Learning. Long story short, convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use  the signal \(h(t) \)
                  as weights to be trained. Nowadays, they are one of the best networks to use in image and video recognition, image classification, etc. And as we have already 
                  pointed out, the linear layer block weights act as a convolution of kernel size 1.
